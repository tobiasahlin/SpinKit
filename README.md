[SpinKit](http://tobiasahlin.com/spinkit/)
============

Simple loading spinners animated with CSS. See [demo](http://tobiasahlin.com/spinkit/).

SpinKit uses CSS animations to create smooth and easily customizable animations. The goal is not to offer a solution that works in every browser. If you're building a site with users running IE9 and below, you'll want to detect support for the CSS `animation` attribute, and implement a fallback animation (e.g. a GIF.)

## Contribution

If you're submitting a new animation, make sure that it looks identical in [all browsers that support CSS animations](http://caniuse.com/css-animation).
